***

- This is a fork (really a [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)) of Mina Markham's excellent macOS setup script, [Formation](https://github.com/minamarkham/formation).
- Details below on what's installed are not up-to-date. See the `swag` folder for what's actually installed.
- `slay` is the runtime (is that the right word?), `twirl` contains all the functions for the script.
- Assets:
    - `apps` are Mac App Store apps installed by the `mas` CLI. (The numbers are IDs you can find in the Share links for apps in the App Store. The app names are just for use by this script and should not contain spaces.)
    - `casks` are Mac apps installed by Homebrew. (Casks prefixed with '#' are ignored. Search for apps on [brew.sh](brew.sh))
    - `brews` are cli tools installed by Homebrew
    - `npm` are Node packages installed by npm
- Heads up: `brew install --cask` fails if a cask app was already installed without using brew. 
- In addition to apps, this script...
    - Sets some system preferences. See the 'CONFIGURE: System & Safari Preferences' section in `slay`.
    - Gives the option of downloading Apple's UI fonts SF Pro, SF Compact, and SF Mono.
- The script can be run using `bash setup.sh`.

# üêù Formation <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minamarkham"><img src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button@2x.png" width="100"></a>

![Let's get in formation](assets/formation.gif)

> Formation is a shell script to set up a macOS laptop for design and development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
git clone git@github.com/minamarkham/formation.git && cd formation
```

Review the script (please don't run scripts you don't understand):

```sh
less slay
```

Slay:

```sh
cd formation
./slay 2>&1 | tee ~/slay.log
```

Just follow the prompts and you‚Äôll be fine. üëå

:warning: Warning: I advise against running [this script](slay) unless you understand what it‚Äôs doing to your computer.

I created this based on my own preferences; your mileage may vary.

Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal.

It is highly recommended to run the script regularly to keep your computer up to date.

Your last Formation run will be saved to `~/slay.log`. To review it, run `less ~/slay.log`.

That's it! :sparkles:

<sub>See [`swag`](swag) for the full list of apps that will be installed. Adjust it to your personal taste.</sub>

It should take less than 20 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

## üå∂ Just add `~/.hot-sauce`

![I got hot sauce in my bag](assets/hot-sauce.gif)

Your `~/.hot-sauce` is added at the end of the Formation script. Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SETUP_ROOT=$HOME/.setup

NERDFONTS_RELEASE=$(curl -L -s -H 'Accept: application/json' https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest)
NERDFONTS_VERSION=$(get_github_version $NERDFONTS_RELEASE)

DIRECTORIES=(
    $HOME/Desktop/code
    $HOME/Desktop/design
    $HOME/Desktop/*dump
    $HOME/Desktop/GIFs
    $HOME/Desktop/projects
    $HOME/Desktop/screenshots
)

NERDFONTS=(
    SpaceMono
    Hack
    AnonymousPro
    Inconsolata
)

step "Making directories‚Ä¶"
for dir in ${DIRECTORIES[@]}; do
    mkd $dir
done

step "Installing fonts‚Ä¶"
for font in ${NERDFONTS[@]}; do
    if [ ! -d ~/Library/Fonts/$font ]; then
        printf "${indent}  [‚Üì] $font "
        wget -P ~/Library/Fonts https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/$NERDFONTS_VERSION/$font.zip --quiet;unzip -q ~/Library/Fonts/$font -d ~/Library/Fonts/$font
        print_in_green "${bold}‚úì done!${normal}\n"
    else
        print_muted "${indent}‚úì $font already installed. Skipped."
    fi
done
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `slay` script for examples.

Formation functions such as `step` and `link` can be used in your `~/.hot-sauce`.

## Known Issues

Cask does not recognize applications installed outside of Homebrew Cask ‚Äì in the case that the script fails, you can either remove the application from the install list or uninstall the application causing the failure and try again.
